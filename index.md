Problems in Software Design, Data Modeling, and Data Analytics for Beginners

Most generally, data models help us to understand the world
But practically speaking, this data being useful often requires us to develop software systems.

# Data

## Unit 1
Information
	What is data?
	information about objects (person)
	information about places (garden)

## Unit 2
Different data structures for different kinds of information
	collections of objects (ingredients array)
	information about relationships (road graph)

Uses of information
	control mechanisms (elevator, stop light)
	access control (employee teams role+team)
	maps (find shortest path)

Part II - interaction

Model a food web
	- as a rules engine
	- as a graph
	- as a set of interacting objects

Implement Publish Subscribe
	- as software objects
	- as a relationship between two software systems
	- as a circuit?

Make a game
	- interaction space
	- collisions
	- win/lose conditions

Part III - specialized systems

Implement Configurable Workflow
	-as a graph
	-dynamic UI 

Implement event logging
	- log db
	- analytics

Implement News Feed
	- model news
	- model friends
  	-dynamic UI (home feed)
	- algorithm to determine feed
	- data: what can you derive from friendships, patterns of location sharing etc
